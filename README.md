### Saarland University. Software Engineering winter semester 20/21. Assignment 2.

What I learned: configurable programming in Java.

This repository contains the submitted version to the Assignment 2 of the Software Engineering course at the Saarland University.

The goal was to program a given task in a configuration-oriented way.

The organizers provided a tool that compiled the configuration-oriented code into a working program based on the specification, 
so I had to write the features in a way that they compile properly as well as the tests for each of them.
